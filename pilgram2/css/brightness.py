def brightness(im, amount=1):
    """Adjusts the brightness.

    A brightness operation is equivalent to the following matrix operation:

        | R' |     | c  0  0 |   | R |
        | G' |  =  | 0  c  0 | * | G |
        | B' |     | 0  0  c |   | B |

    See the W3C document:
    https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/#brightnessEquivalent

    Arguments:
        im: An input image.
        amount: An optional integer/float. The filter amount (percentage).
            Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        The output image.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: if `amount` is less than 0.
